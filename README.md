# First project.
After some thoughts and consideration, I have decided to try my hand on coding/programming. 
Mainly because I want to learn a new skill and know more about computers and also I am still figuring out what to do after my graduation which is due in July 2024.
I started to learn html and CSS on Youtube from Smoljames ( he is a great teacher). My first project is to make Google home page. 
It didn't turn out the right(the icons where you type in the search are stuck in the middle). I don't what went wrong. 
But alas, we keep moving.
